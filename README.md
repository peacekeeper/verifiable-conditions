# Introduction

VerifiableCondition is a new type of verification method for DID Documents. It can be used to express complex conditions and additional meta data about verification methods. It can be used to combine verification methods together to form conjugated conditions such as logical operations &&, thresholds, weighted thresholds, relationships and a delegation to external verification methods.

This new type has been created from discussions during the [Decentralized Identity Foundation](https://identity.foundation)'s ID working group sessions. The need for this type has arisen from the current creation of the EOSIO DID method by [Gimly](https://gimly.io). The type is designed to cover several other important use cases requiring similar conditional logic.

Prior work:
- [Verifiable Conditions planning doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hxEMQxfNuB6Elmd6V-9bEt0kZqSx-DULycn6CjOpMYs) - several VerifiableCondition types have not been added to this draft, see conversation and if you think they are important please submit an issue or PR to add
- [DID core - multisig and delegated use case](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vrmdOnN1tiE54e8h7HyegkJUGyrBUITVFNsAVedUwTE)

## Goals
Create a new verification method type that can:
- Express conditional logic required to validate verification methods
- Express additional metadata about verification methods

## Use Cases

Support for account and key models of the following protocols:
- EOSIO: [Accounts And Permissions](https://developers.eos.io/welcome/latest/protocol-guides/accounts_and_permissions)
- Hyperledger Fabric: [Endorsement policies](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developapps/endorsementpolicies.html?highlight=endorsement%20policy)
- Ripple and BigchainDB: [Composable cryptographic conditionals](https://github.com/rfcs/crypto-conditions)
- KERI: [KERI Thresholds](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keripy/blob/1b6d25a0ada87a65c6a978336c3a1a273c2e53a6/src/keri/core/coring.py#L3151)

# The VerifiableCondition Type

```json
{
    "id": "did:example:123#owner",
    "controller": "did:example:123",
    "type": ["VerifiableCondition", "VerifiableConditionAnd"],
    "verificationMethod": {}
}
```

The type property of a verificationMethod which includes "VerifiableCondition" is a verifiable. A verifiable type MUST also specify at least one or more types which specify how the condition is fulfilled.

The “verificationMethod” property is a singular or array value of other verification methods. These can be any valid type including other VerifiableCondition types. In this way, a recursive structure of infinite complexity can be expressed about the cryptographic material required.

The “verificationMethod” can use a [relative DID URL](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#relative-did-urls) to link to other “verificationMethod”s to avoid duplication in the same DID Document.

## Example
This would check that the signatures match AND( OR( #1-1-1, #1-1-2), #1-2). Note the different types.

```json
{
    "id": "did:example:123#1",
    "controller": "did:example:123",
    "type": ["VerifiableCondition", "VerifiableConditionAnd"],
    "verificationMethod": [{
        "id": "did:example:123#1-1",
        "controller": "did:example:123",
        "type": ["VerifiableCondition", "VerifiableConditionOr"],
        "verificationMethod": [{
            "id": "did:example:123#1-1-1",
            "controller": "did:example:123",
            "type": "EcdsaSecp256k1VerificationKey2019",
            "publicKeyBase58": "5JBxKqYKzzoHrzeqwp6zXk8wZU3Ah94ChWAinSj1fYmyJvJS5rT"
        }, {
            "id": "did:example:123#1-1-2",
            "controller": "did:example:123",
            "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2018",
            "publicKeyBase58": "PZ8Tyr4Nx8MHsRAGMpZmZ6TWY63dXWSCzamP7YTHkZc78MJgqWsAy"
        }]
    }, {
        "id": "did:example:123#1-2",
        "controller": "did:example:123",
        "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2018",
        "publicKeyBase58": "H3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"
    }]
}
```

# Subtypes of VerifiableCondition

## And
```json
{
    "id": "did:example:123#1",
    "controller": "did:example:123",
    "type": ["VerifiableCondition", "VerifiableConditionAnd"],
    "verificationMethod": []
}
```

Fulfilled if all of the verificationMethods provided are fulfilled.

Note: this subtype can be expressed through a Threshold subtype by setting the “threshold” property to the the number of verificationMethods.

## Threshold
```json
{
    "id": "did:example:123#4",
    "controller": "did:example:123",
    "type": ["VerifiableCondition", "VerifiableConditionThreshold"],
    "threshold": 3,
    "verificationMethod": []
}
```

Fulfilled if the number of verificationMethods that are fulfilled are greater than or equal to the “threshold” property.

Note: this subtype can be expressed through a WeightedThreshold subtype by setting all the “weight” properties to 1.

## WeightedThreshold
```json
{
    "id": "did:example:123#5",
    "controller": "did:example:123",
    "type": ["VerifiableCondition", "VerifiableConditionWeightedThreshold"],
    "threshold": 3,
    "verificationMethod": [{
        "verificationMethod": {},
        "weight": 2
    }, {
        "verificationMethod": {},
        "weight": 2
    }, {
        "verificationMethod": {},
        "weight": 1
    }]
}
```

Fulfilled if the sum of the weights of the verificationMethods that are fulfilled are greater than or equal to the “threshold” property.

## Delegated
```json
{
    "id": "did:example:123#10",
    "controller": "did:example:123",
    "type": ["VerifiableCondition", "VerifiableConditionDelegated"],
    "delegatedIdUrl": ""
}
```

Fulfilled if the verificationMethod found by dereferencing the DID URL “delegatedIdUrl” is fulfilled. The dereferenced DID document MUST contain a verificationMethod found using the DID URL. The dereferenced DID document MUST NOT contain multiple verificationMethods found using the DID URL.

## Relationship
```json
{
    "id": "did:example:123#10",
    "controller": "did:example:123",
    "type": ["VerifiableCondition", "VerifiableConditionRelationship"],
    "parentIdUrl": [],
    "childIdUrl": [],
    "siblingIdUrl": []
}
```

Has not fulfillment requirements.

Expresses a relationship between different verificationMethods. One of the properties "parentIdUrl", "childIdUrl" or "siblingIdUrl" MUST be present. Each property can be a DID URL or an array of DID URLs.
